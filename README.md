# ASW_Copia_Issues_Taiga_Frontend_React

Project developed during the 6th trimester for the Applications and Web Services (ASW) subject ([Course Info](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/ASW)) at FIB, Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya in Barcelona.  
It was implemented using **React** and **Vite** as the frontend framework, and **TypeScript** as the programming language.  
The project applies concepts and techniques learned throughout the course and consumes the API previously developed using Ruby on Rails, available here:  
üîó https://github.com/it13aprojecte1/ASW_Copia_Issues_Taiga_Backend_StaticSite

The project was developed by:
* Adri√°n Ferrer  
* √ìscar Cerezo  
* Jan Santos  
* Francesc P√©rez

Taiga board used to manage the project:  
üîó https://tree.taiga.io/project/jansanbas-it13a_project/timeline  
This frontend corresponds to the **3rd Sprint** of the project.

The project backend is deployed on Render:  üîó [https://waslab04-uscf.onrender.com](https://waslab04-uscf.onrender.com)

The project itself is deployed on Render:
üîó [https://taiga-issues-frontend-copia.onrender.com/](https://taiga-issues-frontend-copia.onrender.com/)

It should be noted that the static site allows logging in with multiple accounts. However, the web app does not include any login system; instead, it uses a hardcoded profile through which you can already access and test the API's functionalities.
